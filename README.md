## Frontend
Following packages are used:
* react
* react-router-dom
* axios - for making promise based api calls in react
* sweet alert - for showing alerts
* Bootstrap css

There are following 2 Components:
* Nav -
It is the Navigation components shown at the top of the page.

* Home -
The Home page shown when you run it. <br/>
It has an input field that takes an integer n and a submit button to send to the backend.<br/>
OnSubmit ```getOccurence()``` function is called that takes N from inout and makes an API call to ```/get-occurence?n=${n}```. It uses axios i.e promise based to make ajax requests.</br>
Upon Success the the response comes in ```then()``` block and in case of error it comes in ```catch()``` block.<br/>
In then we got the response and if response Status is 1 then i set the state ```data``` as the ```response.data``` using the ```setState()``` function.
In catch i show an alert showing error message.<br/>
```render method:```
In render function I iterate over the this.state.data array and create a row i.e. '<tr>' containing the word and no of occurence and then that row is shown in the table.

## Backend
Following packages are use:
* express
* body-parser - to parse the POST req body in node
* axios - to make call to fetch a file hosted at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictustech/test/main/README.md]  (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/invictustech/test/main/README.md)
* cors - to enable cross origin resource sharing

The ```GET /get-occurence``` endpoint is called after submitting the value of N from front-end. The N is passed in the query string.

Let's undertand the code that fetches file README.md and finds top N most frequent occurance words.

We use ```axios.get``` to fetch the ```README.md``` file from Invictus website.

I got the string in the ```result``` variable, then I replce the new line characters and tabs with spaces using ```result.replace(/\n\t/g, " ")```.

Then i split the string by delimeter ```" "``` which returns an array of words from the result string.

Then iterate over each word in the array and store the no of occurence of each words in the object ```occrenceMap```.

Then finally sort the ```OccurenceMap``` object by value i.e by count of occurence and return an array from it.

Then slice the top N most frequent words from the array and return it as response.

## The TestCase with data and Screenshot is placed below.

User can enter N number and do submit.The result is shown below as N=13
